📌 Project Overview
AI Floor Plan Analyzer is a computer vision–based web app that automatically detects and classifies rooms from floor plan images.
	•	Identifies room regions
	•	Classifies spaces based on size
	•	Generates visual and analytical outputs

Built using Python, OpenCV, and Streamlit for an intuitive, real-time interface.

⸻

🎯 Objective
	•	Automate floor plan interpretation
	•	Reduce manual layout analysis
	•	Apply computer vision to real-world problems

⸻

🚀 Key Features
	•	Upload floor plan images (PNG, JPG, JPEG)
	•	AI-enhanced room detection
	•	Automatic room classification: Living Room, Hall, Bedroom, Kitchen, Bathroom
	•	Real-time statistics & insights
	•	Visual output with bounding boxes
	•	Export results (CSV, Image, TXT)
	•	Analysis history tracking

⸻

⚙️ System Workflow

1️⃣ Image Preprocessing
	•	Resize images for performance
	•	Color space conversion (BGR → RGB → LAB)
	•	Histogram equalization

2️⃣ Room Detection
	•	Color quantization & segmentation
	•	Mask generation & morphological operations
	•	Contour detection for room areas

3️⃣ Feature Extraction
	•	Area, Perimeter, Aspect ratio, Circularity

4️⃣ Room Classification
•	Very Large → Living Room
	•	Large → Hall
	•	Medium → Bedroom
	•	Small → Kitchen
	•	Smaller → Bathroom
	•	Minimal → Closet
